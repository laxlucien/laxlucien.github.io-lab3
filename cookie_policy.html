            <p>
              When you visit our Digital Services, we, third party service providers, and partners may use "cookies" or similar technologies, such as pixels and SDKs to (i) provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Digital Services and their content (ii) perform analytics, including to analyse and report on usage and performance of our Digital Services and any advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through them (iii) protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity (iv) create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users (including advertising audiences), and (v) for us, our partners and third party service providers to deliver, target, offer, market, or personalise advertising relating to our Offerings or the offerings of our clients and partners (including limiting how often you see an advertisement).

            <p><strong>Cookie description</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Required cookies</strong>
              <br><br>
              These cookies are required to enable core website functionality
              <br><br>
              Strictly necessary cookies or similar technologies: They are essential in order to enable you to move around our Digital Services and use their features, such as accessing secure areas. If you disable these cookies, some or all of the Digital Services’ features may not work.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Performance cookies</strong>
              <br><br>
              These cookies allow us to analyze usage of our Digital Services so we can measure and improve performance
              <br><br>
              Performance cookies or similar technologies: They collect information about how you use our Digital Services, so that we can analyze traffic, understand users' interactions, and improve the relevant Digital Service. Our emails and newsletters may contain a ‘web pixel’ to let us know how you have interacted with what we have sent you. For games, these technologies collect information about your gameplay, including accomplishments, use of features and other in-game activities. We may use third party service providers such as Google Analytics for this purpose who may use their own cookies or similar technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Functionality cookies</strong>
              <br><br>
              Functionality cookies or similar technologies: These allow our Digital Services to remember choices you make (such as your username or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features, including personalized content. They may also be used to provide Digital Services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. Advertising cookies</strong>
              <br><br>
              These cookies are used by advertising companies to serve ads that are relevant to your interests
              <br><br>
              Social media cookies or similar technologies: These are used when you share Information using a social media sharing button or ‘like’ button via our Digital Services, or when you link your account or engage with our content on or through a Social Media Site, such as Facebook or Twitter. The Social Media Site will record that you have done this, and this Information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities, including building custom audiences.
              <br><br>
              Advertising cookies or similar technologies: Some of our Digital Services may use a third-party advertising network, or an affiliated company, to deliver targeted advertising. They may also have the capability to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and track your browsing or usage across our Digital Services and Social Media Sites.
              <br><br>
              Managing cookies and other technologies. For Digital Services in some jurisdictions, including the EEA, you may learn more information about our use of cookies and other technologies, and provide or withdraw consents, or set your cookie preferences and in some cases object legitimate interest purposes for processing your personal information, by clicking Manage Cookies+ or otherwise adjusting cookie preferences. These settings are accessible on a site or app specific basis, at any time through the ‘Manage Cookies+’ link or a similar link located on webpages or in application settings. You may also use your app/browser settings to set your cookie preferences.
              <br><br>
              For many Digital Services in the EEA, we participate in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework, which is described in more detail by navigating to the IAB’s website, and complies with its specifications and policies on applicable websites and apps. OneTrust operates the consent management platform with the identification number 28.
              <br><br>
              Marketing communications. We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences with respect to receiving certain marketing communications from us. If you would like to update these preferences, you can (i) log in to an account you may have created with us to adjust your settings (where the feature is available) or (ii) otherwise submit a request by navigating to our Individual Rights Request Portal. You can also follow the ’unsubscribe’ instructions provided in any marketing email you receive.
              <br><br>
              Ad choices. On our own or working with affiliates or third parties, we may present advertisements and engage in data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics on our Digital Services and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. We, our affiliates, or third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, SDKs, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers and across websites, services, and apps over time, in order to help serve advertising that will be more relevant to your interests on and off our Digital Services and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as ‘interest-based advertising’. We, our affiliates, or third parties may also use this information to associate your different browsers and devices together for interest-based advertising and for other purposes like research, analytics, internal operations, fraud prevention, and enhancing consumer experiences.
              <br><br>
              In addition to managing your preferences through our consent management platform, for more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs by visiting the Your Online Choices website if in the EEA, which is hosted by and can be visited at the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) website; if in Argentina to the Alianza de Publicidad Digital de Argentina (APDA); if in Canada, by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) website and if in the United States, by navigating to the Digital Advertising Alliance of the US (DAA) website. To learn more about interest-based advertising on mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please visit the Ad choice link to download the version of AppChoices for your device. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select but will still allow the collection of Information for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You can therefore continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              The opt out does not block or delete cookies: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.
              <br><br>
              You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Precise location information. To enable or disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection. You may also limit the collection of precise location information from websites through browser settings.
