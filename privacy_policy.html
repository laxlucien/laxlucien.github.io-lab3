              </p>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy explains what personal information WarnerMedia companies ("we", "us", or "our") collect, use, share and otherwise process about individuals (“you”) interacting with our Offerings (“Information”). Also, this Privacy Policy does not apply to Digital Services that are online services targeted at children.
              </p>
            <p>
              Our family of companies is made up of a number of different legal entities and business units. In this Privacy Policy, the Controller or Controllers (“Controller”) of your Information means the company that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how it is processed. Which company is the Controller in relation to the processing of your Information will depend on which Offering you are using; it will often be the company responsible for providing that Offering, as may be set out in our terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some circumstances, more than one Controller may be responsible for processing your Information, for example, where Information is shared with other companies for a purpose set out in this Privacy Policy. Please navigate to our Controller List for more details. If you still have questions about the relevant Controller, please contact us using one of the methods set out below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the laws of some countries outside the European Economic Area, we may need your consent to our processing of your Information set forth in this Privacy Policy. Subject to any indications you may give us to the contrary, such as opting out or not opting in if asked, and where permitted by law, by providing Information or otherwise interacting with our Offerings, you consent to our use of Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read this policy carefully. It explains the types of Information we may collect about you, the purposes for and methods by which we collect it, and (where applicable) the lawful basis on which we do so, as well as information about data retention, your rights and how to contact us. This Privacy Policy covers both our online and offline data processing activities, including Information that we collect through our various Offerings such as those set out below:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Digital Serivces:</strong>

              <br>

            <p>

Certain Offerings (for example, some branded theme parks, online stores, and in-app purchases) are not operated by us but by a third party licensee or the app store; any processing of your personal information by such a licensee or app store is not subject to this Privacy Policy, so please check carefully whether the relevant terms and conditions refer to additional companies.

              Information about your social media engagement, including your interactions with our fan pages/channels/accounts in third party communities, forums, and social media sites, services, plug-ins, and applications (“Social Media Sites”). This may include posts, your 'likes' and other user-generated content that you may provide, as well as details about yourself such as your name, user ID, profile photo, birthday, and, where you allow us to, lists of friends and people you follow. For information about how you can customize your privacy settings on Social Media Sites, and how those Social Media Sites handle your personal information and content, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies, and terms of use.
              <br><br>
              Information shared on public or community forums, including where you share photos, letters, videos or comments, while participating in online forums.

            <p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
            <p>
              In broad terms, we will only retain your Information for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of Information and the reason that we have collected the Information in the first place. For example, some Information related to the provision of our Offerings to you will be kept for a number of years in order to comply with various finance and tax related legal obligations. We have detailed internal retention policies that set out the various retention periods for different categories of Information, depending on our legal obligations and whether there is a commercial need to retain the Information. After a retention period has lapsed, the Information is securely deleted, unless it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. For further information regarding applicable retention periods, you should contact us using the contact methods set out below.
