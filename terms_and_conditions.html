You represent and warrant to CNN that you have the full legal right, power and authority to grant to CNN the license provided for herein, that you own or control the complete exhibition and other rights to the User Content you submitted for the purposes contemplated in this license and that neither the User Content nor the exercise of the rights granted herein shall violate these Terms of Use, or infringe upon any rights, including the right of privacy or right of publicity, constitute a libel or slander against, or violate any common law or any other right of, or cause injury to, any person or entity. You further grant CNN the right, but not the obligation, to pursue at law any person or entity that violates your or CNN’s rights in the User Content by a breach of these Terms of Use.

            </p>
            <p>
              (F) No Obligation.
